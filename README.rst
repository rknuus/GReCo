rexex
=====


Rule EXample EXtractor processes a C++ Core Guideline Markdown file and extracts
code examples for each rule, trying to figure out which code examples should
pass tests of the rule in question and which ones should be reported.

The output of rexex can be fed to static code analyzers like `clang-tidy`,
`cpplint.py`, or Visual Studio to understand the coverage of the rules by the
static code analyzer.
